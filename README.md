# iOS-Swift-Do-Try-Catch-Discussion
This is a demo project for my video tutorials in Youtube that talks about the try-catch in Swift.

Please check my full video tutorial here in Youtube:

In the video tutorial I will show you guys how to use Swift do-try-catch, aka the built in error handling with exceptions using "throws" in your function signature.

As I mentioned, this is more like a discussion, there is no really right or wrong to use it or not use it. But knowing it is always good for you, specially if you just jumped into iOS programming.
